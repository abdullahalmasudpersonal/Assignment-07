                      <p>JavaScript is a client side scripting or browser scripting language. <strong>It is designed with the goal of controlling the behavior at the client level of the website.</strong> But now it runs on any operating system except browsers and it has all the features of other high level programming languages. <strong>JavaScript is called JS for short.</strong>
                        JavaScript is a prototype-based scripting language that has variable, weak type and first class functions. JavaScript is a language that supports an object oriented, functional programming style.
                        JavaScript was launched on Netscape, <strong> a web browser built in the 1990s.</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript is one of the most commonly used scripting languages. The term client-side scripting language means it runs client-side (or on the client machine) inside the web-browser, but one important thing to keep in mind is that the client's web-browser needs to support JavaScript or not. JavaScript must be enabled.Nowadays, most modern web browsers support JavaScript and have JavaScript engine. For example, Google Chrome has its own JavaScript engine called V8.
                        </p>
                        <p> <strong>javascript is an interpreted language.</strong> Not a compiled language. Compiled language is harder than interpreted language. The source code of the compiled language is passed through a program called a compiler, which translates it into bytecodes. Which the machine can understand and operate.
                        The way JavaScript works is interesting. Inside a normal Web page you place some JavaScript code (See How Web Pages Work for details on Web pages). When the browser loads the page, the browser has a built-in <strong>interpreter</strong> that reads the JavaScript code it finds in the page and runs it.</p>

                      <p>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.</p>
                      <p>The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end.
                    <br>
                     The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.

                            sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.
                            <h6>Local Storage</h6>
                            <p>localStorage lasts until you delete it or the user deletes it.</p>
                            <p>sessionStorageover localStorage for security reasons (ie. another person accessing their account at a later time).
                                But if you wanted to save a user's settings on their machine you would probably want localStorage.</p>

                            <p>sessionStorage will only be accessible while and by the window that created it is open. </p>
